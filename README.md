# Slack-Summarizer
A Slack bot that put complex contents into a TLDR &amp; easy to understand format and preserves all the key points.

## Idea
In Tomtom, there are simply too many sliack channels as well as other information channel, which makes our daily information absortion very difficult. There are already people in the organization asking for functionalities to reduce the chaotic nature of our current information sources. Therefore, a slack summarizer would benefit everyone in providing most up-to-date information in a concise way. There are already tools with similar functionalities provided by Slack, however, many information inside Tomtom are confidential and should not go through third party apps. Therefore, it is a valid idea to create such an app by us.

## Scope
The tool should monitor one (or multiple) slack channel(s), once a new message / post arrives, it should trigger the tool to summarize the post into a short summary with only the most important information and keeps all the external links avaliable to the user.

## Current status
Validation test passed. Now #Company-Announcement was selected as the test channel.
